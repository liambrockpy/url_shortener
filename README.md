## Process

## Wins and Challenges

#### Wins

- Displays history of links created with removal functionality
- Successfully deployed and hosted on AWS using custom domain name with SSL Certification

#### Challenges

- One initial challenge we faced was if users input a URL with just the domain name, if that was retrieved from the database and used as a `href` attribute within links, it would see it as relative URL and not external. We therefore built a simple URL parser to add `http://` prefixes to URLs. As a bonus side effect, this also helped reduce possible duplicates within the database too.
- Another fun challenge was creating a recent history of links created using local storage. On first look we realised _"oh, you can only store strings, but we need to save the long and shortened url together!"_. With further reading we discovered we could stringify the data into JSON strings and just parse it back to JavaScript when we needed to display the data.

#### Future features

- Analytics (e.g. clicks on shortened links) - DB table modifications
- Richer styling including animations with Framer
